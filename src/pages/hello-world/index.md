> Oh, cool! Another cis dude decided to dedicate a chunk of the internet to his opinions. Good job!

That's a completely fair take. Trust me, I've let that consideration influence my public contributions for a while. So, what's changed?

In short: **I want to give back to the community that shaped my career.**

I know, it looks so dumb written out. And who the hell do I think I am, that I have anything worth contributing back? But bear with me, I might be able to save this.

## A reference for anyone that wants it

I've been fortunate in my career. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of mentoring a few budding developers. Some friends, some colleagues, and the occasional stranger referred by the former. And even though I have a tendency to attribute my successes to a lot of dumb luck (*classic privilege move*), thats a pretty bullshit way to look at it. First of all, that isn't helpful to anyone that desires a similar outcome. Maybe more importantly, can you even appreciate something that hasn't been properly reflected on?

All that to say, I've always wanted a living reference to point people to. It can be overwhelming to fit a ton of info into an email or a lunch conversation for anyone, myself included.

## Personal goals

Obviously, there are a handful of things I hope to get out of this:

 - Fill in the gaps between documentation and implementation
 - Encourage myself to understand things enough to explain them clearly
 - Improve my written communication
 - Encourage others to contribute to open source
 - Help developers get jobs

## Code of conduct

Finally, I want to create content adhering to a code of conduct that is inclusive to the software developement community, at large. Even though I would not refer to myself as a white guy, every time I've been detained by law enforcement, I've been called in as a caucasian male (*humble brag*). By writing these out, I can come back to it, and if I stray from them, should anyone care, I can be called out accordingly:

 1. Replace problematic tech jargon with inclusive alternatives
 2. Promote a11y best practices 
 3. Promote i18n best practices

I'd personally appreciate any feedback that improves this section.

## Conclusion

So that's it. Now we can get to some code. I hope to see you around!
